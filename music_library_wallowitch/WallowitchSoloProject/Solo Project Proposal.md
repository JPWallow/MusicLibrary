Solo Project Proposal 
Joshua Wallowitch

Sheet Music Library

Project Description:
    I propose to make a sheet music library application for music educators and ensemble directors. In my current career I am a choir director for a school in Camden, NJ. I run a music program for grades 2-8. I have a passion for music and education, and this is an application that I can use to keep myself organized and possibly share with the other music directors in my district to utilize. 
    
    The purpose of this application would be for users to store information about each piece of music that owned by the school. The database will store the name, composer, arranger, publisher, and type(vocal/instrumental) for each song. Each song object will also have an optional piece of data for director's notes. This will help organize the school's sheet music library. 
    
    I also plan for a concert repertoire section of the application where users can store the order of songs that the students performed including the date, grade-level and notes about the concert. This will allow music teachers to look back at past performances and make future song choices based on what worked or did not work in a previous year. 
    
    I would like to have a music community page, this page will allow directors to see what other groups have performed to help other directors come up with concert repertoire ideas. 

Stack:
    I would like to build this application in Python. It is the first stack that I completed back in April/May and would like to revisit and further my skills in that language. 

MVP Feature List:
    -Separate Login and Registration Views. 
    -"Dashboard" with a header navigation menu.
    -"Inventory" page with editing and deleteing routes.
    -"View Concert" page that shows the details of one concert and editing/deleting routes for the user in session.
    -"Past Concerts" page to show past concert information with editing and deleting routes.
    -"Add to Library" page with a form that allows users to create song objects to be stored to inventory their sheet music.
    -"Concert Planner" page with a form that allows users add songs to a concert using a drop down menu for songs owned by the user in session. 
    -"Community Page" that allows users to see a list of other users concerts with links to the View Concert page for that object. 

Stretch Goals:
    -Comments and likes on the community page
    -Icons on the community page if the logged in user owns any of the same songs that another director has used.
